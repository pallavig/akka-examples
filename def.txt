Scala.js Tutorial
This step-by-step tutorial where we start with the setup of a Scala.js sbt project and end up having some user interaction and unit testing. The code created in this tutorial is available with one commit per step in the scalajs-tutorial repository on GitHub.

Step 0: Prerequisites
To go through this tutorial, you will need to download & install sbt (>= 0.13.0). Note that no prior sbt knowledge (only a working installation) is required to follow the tutorial.

Step 1: Setup
First create a new folder where your sbt project will go.

sbt Setup
To setup Scala.js in a new sbt project, we need to do two things:

Add the Scala.js sbt plugin to the build
Enable the plugin in the project
Adding the Scala.js sbt plugin is a one-liner in project/plugins.sbt (all file names we write in this tutorial are relative to the project root):
